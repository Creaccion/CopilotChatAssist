- If relevant, add diagrams using mermaid for clarity.
- If any element can be diagrammed for better understanding, include it with mermaid.
- If applicable, include shapes and/or messages to clarify flow or architecture.
- Improve the current PR description by adding relevant context, but keep existing content unless it no longer applies.
- Return the complete new description, ready to replace the PR body.
- Remove any elements from the description that are no longer relevant.
- Do not include headers or extra text, only the description.

If you generate Mermaid diagrams, make sure that:
- The diagram is valid and free of syntax errors.
- Node labels must be short, descriptive, and must not contain punctuation (such as "?", ".", ",", ";", ":") or special characters.
- For decision nodes, use the format: C{Patch exists}
- Do not add empty lines or extra spaces at the beginning of each line.
- The diagram must be in a pure mermaid code block, without any padding or additional formatting.
- Do not include explanations inside the mermaid block, only the diagram.
- if the description doesn't need a diagram, don't say anything

If you cannot guarantee the validity of the diagram, omit it.
